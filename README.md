# LD38
My Game for LD38 Compo. Theme: A small world

[Entry on the LD website](https://ldjam.com/events/ludum-dare/38/small-planets)

Our cylindrical hero is stuck in space among many small planets! Get between them by jumping and using cannons to get to the end of the level! Collect coins, but beware the strange T-posed things!
